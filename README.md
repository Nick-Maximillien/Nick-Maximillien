# Nicholas Muthoki

#### Infrastructure • Web3 Systems • Applied AI

> I design and build backend-orchestrated systems where correctness, determinism, and reliability matter. My work sits at the intersection of blockchain infrastructure, domain-specific AI, and production backend systems.

**Currently:** Founder & Lead Engineer at [Ithoka Microsystems](https://ithoka-microsystems.vercel.app)

### Selected Systems (End-to-End Ownership)
*I focus on building and owning complete systems — from core logic to deployment constraints.*

| System | Architecture & Complexity | Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agrosight AI** | **Offline-First Inference Engine.** Designed for low-connectivity environments. Runs compressed edge models locally and synchronizes structured metadata to a central store only when connectivity is available. | Python, TensorFlow Lite, React, PWA |
| **DeFi Match Engine** | **Concurrent Order Matching.** Rust-based service focused on memory safety and deterministic execution. Designed to minimize race conditions and ordering ambiguity in high-frequency transaction intake. | Rust, Actix, WebSockets |
| **ArdhiChain Registry** | **Immutable Asset Registry.** ERC-721–based land registry emphasizing access-control patterns, metadata permanence, and auditability. Models real-world property constraints on-chain. | Solidity, Hardhat, IPFS, Next.js |
| **Voting Governance** | **Trust-Minimized State Machine.** Separates identity, voting logic, and auditability to preserve integrity without exposing voter identity. Verification under adversarial assumptions. | Solidity, React, Subgraphs |

### Engineering Philosophy

**Reliability over novelty**
> Prefer boring, proven components on the critical path.

**Systems over features**
> Data consistency, failure modes, and recovery paths matter more than UI polish.

**Infra is part of the product**
> Deployment, secrets handling, and operational clarity are first-class design concerns.

### Active Focus

* **Legal AI:** Building a localized LLM inference pipeline for legal document analysis and auditing.
* **Regulatory Crypto:** Exploring cryptographic verification patterns for regulatory and governance workflows on public chains.
